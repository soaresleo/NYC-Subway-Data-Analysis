# NYC-Subway-Data-Analysis

Here are the code and the data I used in the first project of Udacity Data Science Foundations II Nanodegree.

In the notebook, I had to implement complex [Python 2.7](https://docs.python.org/2/index.html) functions to extract, format, join, resume, describe, and analyze data from the NYC Subway. I also made a <i>mapper</i> and a <i>reducer</i>, using Hadoop/MapReduce technique.

This notebook was originately created by Udacity and, as you go through it, you will see exactly the code and text parts I wrote when was required.

Main Python libraries I used:
  - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
  - [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
  - [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
  - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

Important notes:
  - I had only uploaded one file ("turnstile_data_master_with_weather") because (supposedly :smirk:) that one is all you need, the rest will be automatically downloaded or created by Python functions. Ontherwise, chances are someting is going wrong with code, links, or file's paths.
  - I concluded this project on March 2018 and I'm posting it on May 2020, so I cannot support for occasionally broken links.
  - Comments and texts are in portuguese, so if you get stuck in translating them, message me on Linkedin (my profile link is on my bio). I want to create a separate notebook translated to english as soon as possibile.
